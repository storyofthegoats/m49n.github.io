            <p>
              Matthew Maupin is a long-distance human being — a man propelled endlessly
              forward by some cracked cosmic metronome only he can hear. He runs not for
              fitness or enlightenment but because motion is the one thing that keeps the
              universe from collapsing inward on itself. His miles read like dispatches from
              a fever dream: sunrise highways, half-forgotten trails, hallucinated
              conversations with deer, the kind of meditative delirium only a runner with
              too much heart rate data can truly comprehend. When he isn’t running, he’s
              thinking about running. When he isn’t thinking, he’s probably tuning a guitar
              he bought during a moment of spiritual unrest.
            </p>

            <p>
              Music follows him like a stray spirit. He taught himself guitar and piano the
              way most people learn to make toast — one day it just happened, and suddenly he
              was making noise that meant something. Improvised riffs in empty rooms,
              late-night chords ringing with that old American longing, hands moving because
              they must. He plays with the calm certainty of a man who knows nobody is
              coming to save him, so he might as well soundtrack the madness himself.
            </p>

            <p>
              He collects baseball cards with the manic devotion of a pilgrim gathering
              relics from a religion that doesn’t know it’s a religion. High-grade cardboard
              artifacts, PSA dreams, the whole 1959 Topps odyssey — a holy quest driven by
              ink, nostalgia, and the slow burn of childhood memory. He has stared into the
              soul of a well-centered Mantle and come back changed. Those who know him
              whisper of the CardGoat, a creature born in auction houses and late-night
              scrolling sessions, a being both feared and adored.
            </p>

            <p>
              But the real heart of the story belongs to his family. Stephanie — the axis
              his world tilts around. There is no audit, no run, no card, no song more
              central than her. The animals — the four-legged entourage who treat him with
              equal parts suspicion and reliance — orbit the household chaos like fuzzy
              satellites. They are witnesses to the madness, confidants to the quiet
              moments, and occasional participants in experiments that probably should’ve
              required IRB approval.
            </p>

            <p>And then there were the goats.</p>

            <p>
              For seven years, Matt and Stephanie lived the kind of pastoral fever dream
              people romanticize in bars but never actually commit to. Goat farmers —
              honest-to-god, mud-splattered goat farmers — waking up before the sun,
              milking, feeding, fixing fences, pulling hay from hair, and living on land that
              felt ancient in its own stubborn way. It was a life made from sweat and
              laughter and absurdity, a strange chapter where the Maupins lived freer than
              most people ever dare to. A dream walked all the way to the end, not just
              spoken about in wistful tones.
            </p>

            <p>
              He keeps learning, keeps tinkering, keeps teaching himself new things as if
              knowledge were some combustible fuel that might explode if he ever stops
              acquiring it. His MacBook remains a traveling carnival of ideas — some
              brilliant, some deranged, all undeniably his. Songs, scripts, tools, apps,
              spreadsheets, art — half-finished, over-finished, and occasionally
              transcendent.
            </p>

            <p>
              And he keeps going. Always. Running, creating, loving his people, loving his
              animals, living in the beautiful, ridiculous chaos he built with his own
              hands. Because once you’ve lived seven years with goats, you understand the
              truth: nothing in this world is too strange, too wild, or too sacred to be
              yours.
