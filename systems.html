  <p>
    Matthew Maupin is a long-distance auditor in the grand American tradition — a man who
    runs until the demons get winded, then walks back inside to file a SOX deficiency memo
    with greater accuracy than most people can manage a grocery list. Born with the quiet
    disposition of a man who owns too many spreadsheets and just enough guitars, he took a
    strange and fateful turn somewhere in the Midwest and wound up in Louisville, Kentucky:
    bourbon country, horse country, and a fine place to contemplate internal controls.
  </p>

  <p>
    He collects baseball cards the way a deranged anthropologist collects skulls:
    meticulously, feverishly, and with the cold, steady eye of a man who has seen Mickey
    Mantle prices fluctuate like a bad trip. At any given moment he is hunting down a 1959
    Topps high-number card, muttering about centering percentages like a mystic muttering
    about omens. The CardGoat, they call him. A title earned, not bestowed. A title forged
    in the sulfur glow of late-night auctions and the kind of purchases only understood at
    3:12 AM.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maupin is a runner by habit and compulsion, pounding out miles not because it’s
    healthy but because the alternative is to sit still — a concept he has rejected since
    1997. His logs read like dispatches from an ongoing war between man and pavement. There
    are whispers — unconfirmed, but persistent — that he once went for a “light jog” and
    ended up crossing a state line by accident. When he isn’t running, he’s planning to
    run. When he isn’t planning, he’s probably icing something.
  </p>

  <p>
    Professionally, he serves as Director of Internal Audit, a title which sounds calm and
    administrative but is, in reality, a frontier job — the sort held by lone sheriffs who
    know everyone in town is lying and half of them don’t even realize it. He battles
    financial risk with the grim artistry of a man sharpening a bayonet. He dissects
    balance sheets the way a Vegas card counter studies the twitch in a dealer’s wrist.
    He designs SOX frameworks like a mad architect building a cathedral no one else can
    see but everyone depends upon.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rumor has it he’s building an AI-powered financial-risk oracle — a swirling cosmic
    dashboard that will one day awaken, speak in tongues, and tell executives exactly
    which accounts are about to burst into flame. Whether that makes him a visionary or a
    danger to society remains unclear, but the project continues, fueled by equal parts
    caffeine, righteous indignation, and that strange electric joy found only in
    automation.
  </p>

  <p>
    At home he lives with Stephanie, who tolerates his creative manias with admirable
    grace, and their squadron of four pets, each of whom seems mildly suspicious that Matt
    might be building a spreadsheet about them.
  </p>

  <p>
    In his free hours he conjures websites, builds journals, draws insane parody cards,
    creates mosaics made of Pokémon orbs and cardboard fragments, and produces art that
    looks like it crawled out of an alternate universe where baseball statistics and
    psychedelic posters achieved full sentience. His MacBook is a traveling circus of
    half-finished ideas, wild experiments, and repo scraps that read like the notebooks of
    a polymath who got struck by lightning and became slightly more powerful.
  </p>

  <p>
    And he keeps going. Always. Because once you’ve stared into the abyss of internal
    audit and lived to tell the tale, there’s really nothing left to fear.
