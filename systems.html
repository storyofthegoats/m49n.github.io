            <p>
              Matthew Maupin is a long-distance auditor in the grand American tradition — a
              man who runs until the demons get winded, then walks back inside to file a SOX
              deficiency memo with greater accuracy than most people can manage a grocery
              list. Born with the quiet disposition of a man who owns too many spreadsheets
              and just enough guitars, he took a strange and fateful turn somewhere in the
              Midwest and wound up in Louisville, Kentucky: bourbon country, horse country,
              and a fine place to contemplate internal controls.
            </p>

            <p>
              He collects baseball cards the way a deranged anthropologist collects skulls:
              meticulously, feverishly, and with the cold, steady eye of a man who has seen
              Mickey Mantle prices fluctuate like a bad trip. At any given moment he is
              hunting down a 1959 Topps high-number card, muttering about centering
              percentages like a mystic muttering about omens. The CardGoat, they call him. A
              title earned, not bestowed. A title forged in the sulfur glow of late-night
              auctions and the kind of purchases only understood at 3:12 AM.
            </p>

            <p>
              Maupin is a runner by habit and compulsion, pounding out miles not because
              it’s healthy but because the alternative is to sit still — a concept he has
              rejected since 1997. His logs read like dispatches from an ongoing war between
              man and pavement. There are whispers — unconfirmed, but persistent — that he
              once went for a “light jog” and ended up crossing a state line by accident.
              When he isn’t running, he’s planning to run. When he isn’t planning, he’s
              probably icing something.
            </p>

            <p>
              Professionally, he serves as Director of Internal Audit, a title which sounds
              calm and administrative but is, in reality, a frontier job — the sort held by
              lone sheriffs who know everyone in town is lying and half of them don’t even
              realize it. He battles financial risk with the grim artistry of a man
              sharpening a bayonet. He dissects balance sheets the way a Vegas card counter
              studies the twitch in a dealer’s wrist. He designs SOX frameworks like a mad
              architect building a cathedral no one else can see but everyone depends upon.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rumor has it he’s building an AI-powered financial-risk oracle — a swirling
              cosmic dashboard that will one day awaken, speak in tongues, and tell
              executives exactly which accounts are about to burst into flame. Whether that
              makes him a visionary or a danger to society remains unclear, but the project
              continues, fueled by equal parts caffeine, righteous indignation, and that
              strange electric joy found only in automation.
            </p>

            <p>
              At home he lives with Stephanie, who tolerates his creative manias with
              admirable grace, and their squadron of pets, each of whom seems mildly
              suspicious that Matt might be building a spreadsheet about them.
            </p>

            <p>
                      His MacBook is a traveling circus of half-finished ideas, wild experiments, and
              repo scraps that read like the notebooks of a polymath who got struck by
              lightning and became slightly more powerful.
            </p>

            <p>
              And he keeps going. Always. Because once you’ve stared into the abyss of
              internal audit and lived to tell the tale, there’s really nothing left to
              fear.
