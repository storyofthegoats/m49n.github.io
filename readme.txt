📘 README — m49n.com

m49n.com is a personal website and creative sandbox that hosts a dual-mode journal (raw + AI-interpreted), card tools, experimental pages, and an evolving landing page.
The site is built for flexibility, growth, and eventual separation of public and private content.

This repository serves as the source of truth for all structure, workflows, conventions, and development patterns used in the project.

🧭 1. Project Overview

m49n.com is a modular, hand-coded personal site that includes:

A dual-format journal (raw entry + interpreted entry), written by the user and formatted/generated by AI.

Card-related tools, list-makers, data explorers, and other hobby projects.

A flexible landing page designed for quick iteration and UI experimentation.

A system notes area for frameworks, templates, and structured thinking.

A future-proof architecture enabling a clean split between public and private content.

Everything in the repo is intentionally simple (HTML/CSS/JS) to keep development fast and transparent.

✨ 2. Features

All journal entries live inside /entries/ and follow a consistent naming convention.

📝 4. Journal Entry Workflow

This repository uses a predictable pattern for journal entries.
This workflow must be followed for every new entry.

1. User creates raw journal text

Matt writes a raw journal entry in any format.

2. AI generates interpreted version

Kev rewrites it in a “scaled-down interpretive” style.

3. AI generates the full entry file

Kev produces a complete HTML file with:

metadata header

links to “raw” and “interpreted” sections

both sections formatted cleanly

same fonts and layout used across all entries

4. AI generates the index snippet

Kev also creates a single HTML block for journal.html linking to the new entry.

5. User commits the changes

Matt:

Adds the new HTML file under /entries/

Pastes the index snippet into journal.html

Commits and pushes to GitHub

GitHub Pages deploys automatically

This workflow ensures consistency and keeps the journal system scalable.

🎨 5. Landing Page Customization

The landing page is meant to be modular and easy to evolve.

Key rules:

All UI structure lives in index.html

Global look & feel lives in styles.css

Reusable blocks (cards, lists, sections) should use consistent class names

Any major layout changes should be documented in this README under “Future Enhancements”

When updating the landing page:

Keep sections self-contained

Use semantic HTML

Avoid inline styles

Update the README if new page patterns are introduced

🃏 6. Cards & Tools Section

cards.html is a sandbox page for:

card inventory tools

data input forms

list maker components

prototypes for future projects

When adding new tools:

Keep each tool modular

Document the purpose of each tool in cards.html comments

Update this README if the tool becomes a core feature of the site

🔒 7. Public vs Private Roadmap

Long-term the site will separate public-facing pages from private entries.

Two possible architectures:

Option A — Two repositories (simple)

Public repo

Contains only public pages + entries

Published via GitHub Pages

Private repo

Contains all raw entries + private tools

Never published directly

This is the easiest and cleanest way to separate visibility.

Option B — Single repo with build pipeline (advanced)

Keep everything in one private repo

Entries include frontmatter:

visibility: public


or

visibility: private


GitHub Actions builds HTML and publishes only public entries to a gh-pages branch

This provides automation and scalability but requires scripts.

Either approach is supported by the current repo design.

💻 8. Local Development (Optional)

You can work entirely in GitHub’s UI, but local development is supported:

Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/<your_user>/m49n.com.git
cd m49n.com

Open locally:

Any browser can open the HTML files directly.

No build system or dependencies required.

🚀 9. Deployment (GitHub Pages)

The site is deployed automatically through GitHub Pages.

Deployment rules:

The default branch (usually main) is published

Changes are live within ~30 seconds

Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) clears cache if needed

🧩 10. Future Enhancements / TODO

Journal search engine

Tag & category system

New card tools (pricing, alerts, inventory DB)

Strava integration (running logs)

New landing page modules

Journal timeline view

Entry bookmarking

Private/public pipeline automation

Optional build system (Node or Python)

If any of these features are implemented, update this README to reflect the new standards.

🤖 11. How Kev Should Assist on This Project

This section defines how the AI assistant should operate inside this project.

Kev’s role

Generate full HTML files for journal entries

Generate index snippets for journal.html

Produce clean, modular HTML/CSS updates

Follow the structure defined in this README

Never overwrite files without showing a diff or full replacement

Never introduce new structures without calling them out in this README

Always assume GitHub is the source of truth

Always ask for the current HTML when modifying a file

Avoid making assumptions about deleted or changed structures

When generating code

Keep class names consistent

Keep spacing and indentation clean

Avoid bundling long inline styles

Produce copy/paste-ready blocks

Follow the naming conventions defined by the repo

Preserve backwards compatibility unless explicitly instructed otherwise

When generating journal entries

Maintain the dual-section format

Use the standard metadata header

Keep filenames consistent with the pattern:
YYYY-MM-DD-title.html

Provide both the entry file AND the journal index snippet

When updating site structure

Only modify what the user has asked to modify

Explain structural changes in plain English

Update this README if site patterns or workflows evolve

🧾 12. License

Personal project.
No redistribution or commercial use without permission.

🧩 13. Notes

This README should be updated whenever:

workflows change

file structure changes

templates evolve

new sections are added

public/private architecture is implemented

It is the master document that keeps the project consistent across time.
