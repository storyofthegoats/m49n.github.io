          <p>
            Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
            continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
            proposition that all men are created equal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,
            or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are
            met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a
            portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here
            gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting
            and proper that we should do this.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate—we cannot consecrate—we
            cannot hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who
            struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add
            or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say
            here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the
            living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they
            who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us
            to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from
            these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which
            they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve
            that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under
            God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the
            people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
            earth.
