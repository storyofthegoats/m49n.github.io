        <div class="body-content">This year’s Christmas movie season has basically turned into a slow-rolling festival running in the background of the house. Modern streaming makes it too easy—half the time Christmas Vacation is just playing somewhere in the periphery like a seasonal soundtrack. I think I’ve had Clark Griswold electrocuting himself eight times now without ever actually sitting down for a full watch. But that’s part of the fun: these movies don’t need attention anymore; they’re just the texture of December.

We’ve already knocked out a decent list: Bad Moms Christmas, Bad Santa, Elf, 8-Bit Christmas, Christmas with the Kranks, A Christmas Story, and A Christmas Story Christmas. Plus the endless rotation of Christmas Vacation, which I suppose counts as cardio at this point. It’s a solid spread—raunchy, nostalgic, weird, and comforting in different proportions. The kind of list that builds itself year after year until it becomes a ritual instead of a choice.

The plan going forward feels familiar too. Home Alone and Home Alone 2 are getting saved for a night when we actually want to give them full attention. We’re going old-school with those—DVDs only. A proper 2000-era experience with the disc menus, that weird Dolby trailer, and the grainy transfer that feels like Christmas morning at your parents’ house. And then, as always, The Night Before on Christmas Eve. That one is an actual tradition now—not background sound, but a real event. It’s comforting in its own chaotic way.

I tried to sneak It’s a Wonderful Life into the mix this year, but Stephanie just can’t get into it. I respect that. The whole thing is too slow, too old, too drenched in the specific sadness of its era. Maybe someday. Maybe never. Not everything becomes a tradition, and that’s okay.

From here, the rest of December will probably fill itself in—some Grinch, maybe Four Christmases, the usual comfort rewatches. But what I like most is that none of this is planned with any seriousness. The movies drift in, drift out, and somehow stitch the season together. It’s a nice little ritual that doesn’t ask for anything from us but to exist alongside it.</div>
