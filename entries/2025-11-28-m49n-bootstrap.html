started with this loose idea about journaling in chatgpt and somehow turning it into a private online diary. 
didn't really want a "blog" and definitely didn't want to mess with wordpress or a bunch of plugins.

bought m49n.com kind of on instinct. played around with github pages, broke it, reset it, and then finally got a clean landing page online. 
spent way too long fighting tiny things like folders, font choices, and dns settings, but it was kind of fun in a nostalgic way — like coding html in 2000, except the stakes are higher and the design is less embarrassing.

big thing that clicked tonight: i don't actually want to maintain some huge content machine. i want a central place that feels like a ledger of my life and work. 
selected entries only. the real mess can stay in my head or in private notes. 

dual view idea feels right: my actual words on one side, and a cleaned, more honest interpretation on the other. future me reading this will probably laugh at how precious i was about fonts.

Tonight I finally gave shape to an idea that’s been floating around for a while: 
a place where I can think out loud, privately, but still have enough structure 
that it feels like a system instead of a mess.

I bought m49n.com, wrestled with GitHub Pages, broke things, reset things, and
slowly rebuilt a clean landing page. It was equal parts nostalgic and 
frustrating — echoes of teaching myself HTML years ago, except now I care 
about typography, structure, and mood instead of animated GIFs.

The important realization was that I don’t want a blog, and I don’t want to
feed a content machine. I want a ledger: a curated surface where only the 
entries that matter make it through. The rest can stay in private journals, 
notes, and throwaway drafts.

The dual-view idea feels like the right compromise between honesty and clarity.
On one side: my raw words, unedited. On the other: a cleaned, organized,
sometimes more brutally honest interpretation. If I keep doing this, future me
will be able to see both what I said and what I meant.

Somewhere between those two panels is the version of me I’m actually trying 
to understand.

- keep the site small and intentional; no obligation to post constantly.  
- use this dual-view format for selected entries only.  
- let the real journaling happen elsewhere, then graduate pieces here.  
- treat m49n as a ledger, not a performance.
