I notice as I study the behaviors around my anxiety that I enjoy pushing myself into a hyperactive state. I’ve talked about layering stimulants and my use of prednisone. I now associate those behaviors with my tendency to do my Marie Condo style day around the house where I work my self into a crescendo of non-stop activity. These periods of cleaning, organizing, resetting, curating, collecting, playing, and moving about typically end in either one of two ways. I fall asleep due to the fact that I’m probably also sleep deprived or I fall asleep because I’ve finally consumed enough food/beverage/other and can’t function anymore. I label these sessions as fun and productive, and they often are. But there’s clearly a detrimental effect on my body and my mind by feeding into this behavior. Caffeine is part of it too, and of course here I am at 4am drink the first pot, which I had self-prescribed as something to stop doing for these very reasons being analyzed here.

Why don’t I want to be hyperactive? Well I guess I’m trying to find a middle state of sorts at the moment? More of a balanced continuous line rather than the peaks and troughs I have been putting myself through. His and lows, waves and crashes, there are some good metaphors to describe it. I read posts online talking about being overstimulated and how you need to reset your dopamine by doing nothing for some extended periods of time. I notice that even in my downtime, my relaxation time, that I tend to constantly stay busy with tasks exactly like what I’m doing right now; journaling, scrolling, building, listing. I probably do need to replace some of these activities with meditation, silence, rest, and nothingness. Not sloth, but a chance for the mind to heal.

These are my thoughts on that topic at the moment. I’m staying dialed into my various emotional and mental states as I work through the difficulties of my increased tinnitus (which has not subsided despite my increased tolerance and decreased anxiety over it). I’m journaling my feelings when I feel that they have gelled into a cognizant topic of thoughts. I’m documenting failures in my attempted changes in behavior patterns, such as the fact that this morning I’m two cups into a pot of coffee by 4:45am. I believe that there is a path to self-improvement if I can continue to eliminate the worst of my outlying behaviors and replace them with grounded calming processes.</div>

          <div class="panel-body">I’m starting to see a clearer pattern in how my anxiety pushes me toward hyperactivity. The stimulant stacking, the prednisone bursts, the whip-myself-into-motion “Marie Kondo days” — they all form this ritual of escalating activity that feels productive but costs me on the back end. I run myself up the crescendo until my body forces an exit: either I crash from exhaustion or from finally giving it enough fuel to shut down. Even though these sessions can be genuinely fun, there’s no denying the physical and mental toll of running myself this hard. Caffeine is tangled in it too, and here I am again at 4 a.m. pouring the first pot I swore I’d step away from.

So why not be hyperactive? I think I’m aiming for something steadier — a middle bandwidth instead of these spikes and collapses. The metaphors come easy because the feeling is familiar: highs and lows, waves and breaks. I read about overstimulation and dopamine resets, how strategically doing nothing can recalibrate the system. But even my attempts at rest still turn into activity — journaling, scrolling, building, fiddling. Maybe the corrective action here isn’t slowness, but actual stillness: meditation, quiet, deliberate nothingness that lets the mind recover rather than stall.

For now, these are the thoughts that have settled enough to write down. I’m tracking my emotional states alongside the ongoing tinnitus, which still hasn’t faded even though my fear of it has. I’m trying to record these moments when they crystallize into something coherent, and I’m noting the slip-ups — like the fact I’ve already had two cups of coffee before dawn. But I can see the shape of a path forward: pruning the outermost extreme behaviors and replacing them with calm, grounding processes. If I can keep moving in that direction, even imperfectly, momentum might finally tilt toward improvement.</div>
