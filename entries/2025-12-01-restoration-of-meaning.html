Journal 12/1/25 4:45am: I’m finishing the longest break of time I’ve ever had from work. Still less than two weeks, but a sabbatical of sorts. It took a health crisis to convince me I needed the time, and honestly I’d take longer if I had it. I’m reflecting on that time and some of the value lessons I processed during my time walking, talking with Stephanie, and journaling.

So here it is: A reminder of things I realized and decided could be done differently while I was on break:

1. Living each day in the present, which for me means less worrying about future scenarios. This does not mean ignoring health or being reckless.
2. Not getting upset about small things. Life is funny and you just have to step back and take a look from a sider perspective. 
3. Stop working early in the morning. People are distributed by you sending emails at 5am, both judgmentally and literally. Schedule all emails at a minimum but also work less in the pre-dawn.
4. Replace idle time and wasted work time with productive tasks in lieu of something worse. 
5. Stop leaving unfinished business. No more of the 88% guy.  Spend some time at the end of the year finishing existing projects and goals instead of dreaming up new ones.
6. Leave the best possible situation behind. Not in a morbid way, but it is smart to set your loved ones up for both comfort and lasting memory.
7. Do the things. There is no reason is save endlessly and plan for some future self that is unlikely to materialize in your given vision. Be a good saver but also do some spending.

I came across the phrase “the restoration of meaning… is what saved my life” this week and it resonated with my experience over the past several. Most people crave an occasional life reset, and I’ve always been a huge fan of the idea. This reset wasn’t planned or welcomed with open arms. It was painful and tragic and has lastly side effects. But I’m pleased with my personal growth as I head back into normal life this morning.

I’m coming off an unexpected break, forced by a health crisis, and realizing how much I needed it. In less than two weeks, long walks, talks with Stephanie, and journaling gave me a reset. Here’s what I’m carrying forward: live in the present without being reckless, let small annoyances go, stop firing off pre-dawn emails, trade idle time for worthwhile tasks, finish what I start, leave loved ones set up well, and spend on life instead of hoarding for a future that may never match the plan.

The phrase “the restoration of meaning… is what saved my life” hit home. This reset was painful and unplanned, but it brought clarity. I’m heading back to work with more gratitude, more intention, and a stronger sense of what matters.
